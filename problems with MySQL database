####VIEW in MySQL####
There are two ways to create views in MySQL:
The first way: MySQL creates a temporary table based on the view definition statement and executes the incoming query on this temporary table.
The second way: MySQL combines the incoming query with the query defined the view into one query and executes the combined query.

##So temporary query result can be stored in the view tables.##

####VIEW in MySQL####
There are two ways to create views in MySQL:
The first way: MySQL creates a temporary table based on the view definition statement and executes the incoming query on this temporary table.
The second way: MySQL combines the incoming query with the query defined the view into one query and executes the combined query.
The difference between views and tables is that views are built on top of other tables and do not contain data themselves. If data is changed 
in relevant tables, then this change will be reflected in views.

####different join statement####
1. left join / right join:(select * from table A left/right join table B on A.key = B.key)
the left/right table is fully returned, with null values in the unmatched columns of the other table. 
For left join, the rows that exist in table right but not in table left will not appear in the result;
2. inner join: the exact matched rows of both tables on the matching criterion;But the common columns would appear repeatedly.
3. cross join (Cartesian Product): returns all the possible combinations.So there will be no matching criterion, no where or on clause.
4. natural join: the number of columns will be fewer than that of inner join. The common columns of both tables would just appear once. 
5. full join: the different point from cross join is that cross join just returns all possibilities, but full join still uses a matching statement,
i.e. where or on clause, then return all matched rows and fulfill blank columns with NULL.

6. select * from table A left/right join table B on A.key = B.key where B.key / A.key is NULL;
this will return all the rows in A/B except the common rows of both tables.

7. select * from table A full join table B on A.key = B.key where A.key is NULL or B.key is NULL.
this will return all the rows of A and B except the common rows of both tables.

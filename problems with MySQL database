####VIEW in MySQL####
There are two ways to create views in MySQL:
The first way: MySQL creates a temporary table based on the view definition statement and executes the incoming query on this temporary table.
The second way: MySQL combines the incoming query with the query defined the view into one query and executes the combined query.
The difference between views and tables is that views are built on top of other tables and do not contain data themselves. If data is changed 
in relevant tables, then this change will be reflected in views.
